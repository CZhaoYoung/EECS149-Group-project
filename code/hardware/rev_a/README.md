Hardware Files
==============

The Berkeley Buckler was created in
[Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) and the `buckler.sch`
and `buckler.brd` files are Eagle schematic and board files respectively.
Schematic and board files can be viewed without Eagle in `buckler.pdf`.
`buckler_bom.xlsx` is the Bill of Materials (list of parts). It is also
provided as `txt` and `csv` files for convenience.
